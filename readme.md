# HexaDoken Legacy Continued

This is a fix/update of HexaDoken's original 'Hideous Destructor' addons.
It currently adds both recast support and proper spawners for the No-Scope Boss.
Current plans are to update most of HexaDoken's addons and add them to this, minus the joke ones.

- HexaDoken, for the original addons.
- Kris, for the recast fixes and support for the No-Scope Boss.
- FDA, for the Event Handler and Menu code.
- Boss Rifle Code: MatthewTheGlutton/Matt, Hideous Destructor

TO-DO:
